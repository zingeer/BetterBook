# BetterBook
A plugin for minecraft that adds the number of sheets in the capital book and the ability to tear them out.
###Setup
After running the plugin, you will have a config file in `BetterBook / setup.yml`. There you need to install one of the languages:  
- english ("en_EN")
- russian ("ru_RU")

English is the default, and the config looks like this
```yaml
lang: en_EN
```
  
!!Wrong!! You cannot insert a leaf into a workbook in creative mode !!Wrong!!
